# FakeServerQueries [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/In-line/FakeServerQueries.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/In-line/FakeServerQueries)
Fake server queries is a [AMX Mod X](https://github.com/alliedmodders/amxmodx) module designed for modifying [A2S_INFO](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO) and [A2S_PLAYER](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_PLAYER) HLDS server queries.
The original module from which I got inspiration was developed by [Shooting King](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=244450), but it was not updated long ago and had some flaws.

For quite a time the falsification of players in the server browser was a privilege for some servers. Master Servers administrators didn't fight against such issue. They ignored it, because it wasn't mainstream in the community. So my another goal is to cause a ["Tragedy of the commons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) making this unfair method of self-promoting of the server ineffecient and to force MS owners to aknowledge this issue.

Another reason was a release of shady non-GPL AMXX module which is basically a renaming of the Shooter King's work, without any new features.

So here it is Fake ~server queries~ players module that was lightly tested and written in short time.

Installation process is same as for any AMXX module and plugin.
